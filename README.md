What Happens When Data Meets Health?

In a world where healthcare decisions can mean life or loss, data becomes the lifeline that guides action.

Hello!
I’m Ghiyathat Abdulrahman, a Public Health and Data Analyst passionate about transforming raw health data into insights that inspire better decisions.

This portfolio brings together my selected projects that explore how data can improve healthcare performance and policy. From cleaning messy hospital records to building interactive Power BI dashboards, each project highlights a critical skill — data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and storytelling.

I’ve worked across tools like Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel, analyzing disease prevalence, simulating environmental conditions, visualizing vital signs, and uncovering cost drivers in healthcare systems.

These projects were carefully chosen to reflect real-world challenges — understanding patients, evaluating providers, and driving efficiency through data.

Together, they tell one story:
Data is more than numbers; it’s the pulse of public health.

Thank you for reading through to the end — below are my featured projects.
